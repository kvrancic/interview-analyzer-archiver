Speaker 1: Yeah, not bad. So yeah, before we get started with the technical part of the interview, if I just quickly introduce myself. So I'm Kevin, I'm a quant researcher at DaVinci. I've been in the company for two years. I started in Amsterdam on the digital assets desk, and recently I moved to Hong Kong to help start the team here. Maybe you can tell me a little bit about yourself?

Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm Vica, I'm currentlyâ€” I just finished my third year of mathematics, so my bachelor's degree, and my plan is to enroll in Masters of Statistics here in Zagreb. I'm also part member of a finance club where I'm in a group called algorithmic analysis and market modeling. That's when I really started to be interested in trading, and also we as members of that group also compete in, let's say, some hackathons and things like that. For example, Algo trading hackathon, which my team this year was first. So I'm really proud of that. And yeah, except for that, I really like probability, statistics, and thinking in that way."""
