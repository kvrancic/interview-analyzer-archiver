But for me, the thing that pulled me away was, as a trader you are a little bit more into making kind of on-the-fly decisions and less about longer-term work. And one thing that from my background was appealing is just being able to work on more longer-term projects and thinking a little bit more deeply about problems. But that being said, I think at Da Vinci more than other trading firms, it's a little bit less clear the distinction between a quant researcher and a trader, and it's a quant trader. Because essentially there's no clear distinction in work. So I would bet even now I spend a lot of my time trading because I think it gives me better ideas and I can understand the market a bit better, and then traders also spend time doing research projects. So it\u2019s not something I would worry too much about the distinction of, at least at Da Vinci. That's more or less why I chose.",
