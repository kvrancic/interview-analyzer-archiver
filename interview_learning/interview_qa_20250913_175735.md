## ALGORITHMIC TRADING

### Question 1
**Q:** What would you say a few things you’ve taken away from that experience are?

**Candidate:** A few things—first of all, that it’s really hard. It’s really hard and for us students, it isn’t—I wouldn’t say possible because in theory it’s possible, but it isn’t too easy to do something good. So yeah, the most—the things I like about trading is the probability, statistics, and that it’s high-paced also, so you need to be quick on your feet and think of, let’s say, solutions and things like that.

**Evaluation:** Partially

**Model Answer:** The candidate highlights the difficulty of trading and the need for quick thinking and problem-solving. They also mention enjoying the probabilistic and fast-paced nature of trading.

**Key Concepts:** difficulty of trading, probabilistic nature of trading, fast-paced decision making, problem-solving skills

## TRADING

### Question 1
**Q:** And what kind of asset classes did you trade in your competitions?

**Candidate:** We traded—so it was a simulated market. It was a simulated market, and we traded on assets—they were modeled by some models I can’t really remember now. For example, one model was basically drawing cards and that's how much the market moves. And yeah, we traded options and futures there, on those assets.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "In the simulated market competitions, we traded options and futures. These were based on assets whose movements were determined by various model

---

## OPTIONS

### Question 1
**Q:** Ok, on the topic of options, you know some of the basics?

**Candidate:** Depends on what are the basics.

**Evaluation:** Partially

**Model Answer:** The candidate's answer is partially correct because understanding what constitutes 'basics' is crucial before confirming knowledge. However, a more direct confirmation of their understanding of fundamental options concepts would be more informative.

**Key Concepts:** Options Basics, Call Options, Put Options, Strike Price, Expiration Date, Premium

---

### Question 2
**Q:** Ok, I mean maybe you can just start by telling me what a call option is.

**Candidate:** A call option, that's basically an agreement that the person who owns the call options has an opportunity to buy at a later time that underlying asset for strike price, but it isn’t obligated to buy it for that price.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "A call option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset at a specified price (the st

---

### Question 3
**Q:** What's the value of the option?

**Candidate:** Two.

**Evaluation:** Yes

**Model Answer:** The value of the option is two. This is determined by counting the number of shaded squares within the option.

**Key Concepts:** counting, visual interpretation

---

### Question 4
**Q:** So now let’s say I’m instead one year away from expiring. Would you say that the value of this option is more or less than two?

**Candidate:** More than two.

**Evaluation:** Yes

**Model Answer:** Yes, the value would be more than two. As the option approaches expiration, its time value decreases, but the intrinsic value (the difference between the stock price and the strike price) remains. If the stock price is significantly above the strike price, the intrinsic value alone will be greater than two.

**Key Concepts:** Time Value of Options, Intrinsic Value of Options, Option Pricing

---

### Question 5
**Q:** And what’s your intuition for that?

**Candidate:** My intuition for that is that call option is limited for my potential losses, and it is unlimited for my potential gains. So you are basically paying for that stop at losses, let's say.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "The intuition is that buying a call option limits your maximum loss to the premium paid. Conversely, the potential profit is theoretically unlim

---

### Question 6
**Q:** How would you compare the value of a five-year-out option to a one year out option?

**Candidate:** Yeah, five-year is definitely more expensive because let’s say it has more time to go up.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "A five-year-out option is generally more expensive than a one-year-out option because it has a longer time horizon for the underlying asset's pr

---

### Question 7
**Q:** Do you know what delta is?

**Candidate:** I think delta is, let’s say, a derivation or something like that. I know that delta can’t be larger than 1. Delta is something like if my underlying assets increase by one, how much will my option price increase, I think.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Partially",
    "model_answer": "Delta is a measure of an option's price sensitivity to a $1 change in the underlying asset's price. It ranges from 0 to 1 for call options

---

### Question 8
**Q:** So let’s say I’m at expiry… What do you think—so as a function of the underlying price, what do you think the delta of the 98 call looks like?

**Candidate:** The delta of 98 call… we are at how—expiration date? One second… It's very close to one.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Partially",
    "model_answer": "At expiration, the delta of a call option is 1 if the underlying price is above the strike price (in-the-money) and 0 if it's below the st

---

### Question 9
**Q:** So, no, you don’t need to make a function, I’m just asking you, if the underlying is trading at 100 and the strike price is 98, what’s the delta of your option one second before expiring?

**Candidate:** Just to be clear, so strike price is 98, right? Current underlying asset is 100. And we are one second from expiry. And I need to make a function of what exactly? So, no, you don’t need to make a function, I’m just asking you, if the underlying is trading at 100 and the strike price is 98, what’s the delta of your option one second before expiring?

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "The delta of an in-the-money option, with the underlying at 100 and strike at 98, one second before expiry would be very close to 1. This is bec

---

### Question 10
**Q:** Ok, correct. Why do you say that?

**Candidate:** Because we are so close to expiry date, every move—it doesn’t carry enough time to move much, let’s say. So one increase of underlying asset, so basically we would have a profit of 3, and the price of the options will then increase by 1 also. Because basically it doesn’t have enough time to move.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Partially",
    "model_answer": "The candidate is partially correct in that time decay (theta) significantly impacts option prices as expiration approaches. However, the s

---

### Question 11
**Q:** And using similar logic, would you say the value of the option is if the underlying trades at 96?

**Candidate:** At 96? Are we also one second from expiry? It’s zero? If it can be negative… I don’t know if it can be negative, but it’s zero.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "Yes, if the underlying is trading at 96 and the option is at-the-money or out-of-the-money with very little time to expiry, its intrinsic value 

---

### Question 12
**Q:** Well, you tell me, can it be negative?

**Candidate:** Uhm... Not really.

**Evaluation:** Partially

**Model Answer:** It depends on the context. For example, temperature can be negative, but quantities like mass or length are always non-negative.

**Key Concepts:** Contextual dependence of numbers, Non-negative quantities

---

### Question 13
**Q:** So that was one second from expiry, where you have this, essentially, delta profile of a step function at the strike price, right?

**Candidate:** At the strike price, step function? What do you mean by step function? What is the domain of that function? Underlying asset, right?

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Partially",
    "model_answer": "The candidate correctly identifies that the question is referring to the delta of an option at expiration. However, they seem to misunders

---

### Question 14
**Q:** I’m just saying, so let’s say I’m one second before expiry. And if underlying is trading below the strike price, we kind of establish it’s delta zero, and if it trades above, it’s more or less delta one, right?

**Candidate:** Uhm… yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Partially",
    "model_answer": "While delta approaches 0 for out-of-the-money options and 1 for in-the-money options very close to expiry, it's not a strict binary. The e

---

### Question 15
**Q:** So what do you think happens to that profile as you move away from expiry?

**Candidate:** As I move away from expiry... What happens to the what? The delta or...?

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "No",
    "model_answer": "As you move away from expiry, the delta of an option generally moves closer to zero. This is because the probability of the option expiring in-th

---

### Question 16
**Q:** Yeah, to the shape of the delta as a function of underlying price.

**Candidate:** I would say… Hmm... Ok, I’m not sure again I understand. So, are we, let's say, moving in time to the expiration or...?

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** The question asks about the shape of the delta as a function of the underlying price, not time to expiration. Delta's shape is typically an S-curve, increasing from -1 to 1 as the underlying price rises, with the steepest slope around the at-the-money price.

**Key Concepts:** Delta, Option Greeks, Underlying Price, S-curve

---

### Question 17
**Q:** Now let’s say we are five years from expiry. What do you think the delta as a function of the current underlying price looks like?

**Candidate:** Oh, the current underlying price… So, if it’s very close to the underlying price, and five years… I would say…

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** Five years from expiry, the delta of an option will be very close to the delta of the underlying asset itself, regardless of the strike price. This is because the option is deep in-the-money and will move almost dollar-for-dollar with the underlying.

**Key Concepts:** Delta, Time to Expiry, In-the-money options

---

### Question 18
**Q:** Would you expect the delta to still be one?

**Candidate:** No, it should be definitely lower because a change today, let’s say, matters less than a change one second before. So one increase in one matters much less than an increase because it has time to move much more up or down.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "No",
    "model_answer": "No, the delta would not still be one. The delta represents the change in option price for a one-unit change in the underlying asset's price. As t

---

### Question 19
**Q:** And what do you think that number tends towards as you move further and further away from expiry?

**Candidate:** I would say zero.

**Evaluation:** Yes

**Model Answer:** As you move further away from expiry, the probability of an option expiring worthless increases significantly. Therefore, the expected value or the price of the option tends towards zero.

**Key Concepts:** Time Decay (Theta), Option Pricing, Probability of Expiry

---

### Question 20
**Q:** Ok, why?

**Candidate:** Because, yeah, because of that—because it has a lot of time to move, so one move up doesn’t really change that much in the long run. That's my intuition, let’s say.

**Evaluation:** Yes

**Model Answer:** The candidate's intuition is correct. In a game with many turns, a single move has a diminishing impact on the overall outcome because there are many subsequent opportunities to adjust and recover from any initial disadvantage.

**Key Concepts:** long-term strategy, diminishing marginal returns, game theory

---

## PROBABILITY

### Question 1
**Q:** So if every team is equally skilled, then what’s the expected value of each team?

**Candidate:** Expected value of each team is... one second… It should be 50.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "If every team is equally skilled, then each team has an equal probability of winning any given match. Therefore, the expected value of each team

---

### Question 2
**Q:** So what’s the expected value—can you calculate for me the expected value of team 1?

**Candidate:** Expected value of team 1 is… ok, one second…

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** The expected value of team 1 is calculated by summing the products of each possible outcome's value and its probability.  Without knowing the specific outcomes and their probabilities for team 1, the expected value cannot be determined.

**Key Concepts:** Expected Value, Probability, Outcomes

---

### Question 3
**Q:** So basically to get number one prize it’s 75% times 75%, so that’s the chance of winning 120 points. And plus we need to calculate chance on winning the second prize, that’s 0.75 chance times 25% chance because team number 1 needs to win its first match then lose its second match.

**Candidate:** It should be 82.5, if I didn’t make any mistake.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "No",
    "model_answer": "The candidate's calculation for the second prize is incorrect. The probability of winning the second prize (Team 1 wins first match, loses second

---

### Question 4
**Q:** Ok, so currently the expected value of me pulling—turning face up one card is… that is 100 divided by 4, so that’s 25. So yeah, the expected value of me turning up one card and discarding one card is currently exactly the same. But I think that maybe I will get more information if I turn one card face up.

**Candidate:** So I will on first turn, turn one card face up.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "The candidate's reasoning is sound. Turning one card face up provides direct information about that card, which is valuable for decision-making 

---

### Question 5
**Q:** Ok. Yep, correct. So let's say the first card you turn over is 30. Yep, what do you do now?

**Candidate:** Ok, quickly calculating again expected value, so that’s now 70 divided by 3… so that’s 23.3. So currently, based on expected value, it’s worse for me to turn one card face up. It should be better for me to discard it. And that also has—to me—has a good intuition because 30 was one of the higher cards, so there are more lower number cards left.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "The candidate correctly calculates the new expected value of the remaining cards as 23.3. This is lower than the value of the card they turned o

---

### Question 6
**Q:** So now let's think a bit more about the expected value of the game as a whole. So not given that first card is 30, but rather starting the game from scratch.

**Candidate:** Ok.

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** The candidate's answer 'Ok.' is not sufficient to answer the question about the expected value of the game from scratch. To calculate the expected value, one needs to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities, then sum the products of each outcome and its probability.

**Key Concepts:** Expected Value, Probability, Game Theory

---

## EXPECTED VALUE

### Question 1
**Q:** So can you make me a quick, without doing any more calculations, can you make me a quick market for the expected value of team 2?

**Candidate:** Team 2, ok, so I’m left with how much? 95, right? We said 95 points for team 2. Ok, so definitely team 2 should have expected value more points of team 3. So 95 divided by 2 is 47.5, and let's say around 60. That is around 60. And how large of a spread do I need to make? Two points is fine. What? Two points? So let's say 58, uh no, 59, 61.

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** The candidate incorrectly divides the total points by two and then arbitrarily assigns a market. A market for the expected value of Team 2 would be a price that reflects its probability of winning. Without knowing the probabilities or the total points available for betting, a market cannot be accurately constructed.

**Key Concepts:** expected value, probability, market making

---

## DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY

### Question 1
**Q:** Now this game is going to be that I put the cards face down in front of you. And you, at every turn, have two options: you can choose to turn over a card, turn over a random card, and receive that value in dollars, or you can choose to discard a card and receive $25. But you do not get to see the card that you discarded. So let’s play the game. You have four face-down cards in front of you. Are you—what are you going to do? You going to randomly pick one, or are you going to discard and take 25?

**Candidate:** Can just quick ask, do we do one turn of this game or until all cards are—

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "The candidate's question is a reasonable clarification before proceeding. Understanding the game's duration is crucial for strategic decision-ma

---

## STRATEGY

### Question 1
**Q:** Ok, so let's say you discarded your second card. Logically, you would have no reason to keep cards after that, right?

**Candidate:** Yeah, yeah.

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** No, that's not necessarily true. You might discard your second card and still have a reason to keep other cards, depending on the game's rules and your strategy. For example, you might be trying to form a specific hand or waiting for better cards.

**Key Concepts:** game strategy, decision making, conditional logic

---

### Question 2
**Q:** So if you picked 30, you're saying you would just discard the last 3 cards?

**Candidate:** Yeah, yeah, actually yeah, because if I turn face up them, I will— in the end I will have total 70, and if I discard all three cards, I will have 75. So yeah, definitely, I’ll discard them, all of them, yeah.

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** The candidate's reasoning is flawed. If they pick 30 cards, they have 30 cards. Discarding 3 cards would leave them with 27 cards, not 75. The goal is to maximize the number of cards, so discarding cards that are part of the initial selection is counterproductive.

**Key Concepts:** basic arithmetic, understanding of game objectives, strategic decision-making

---

### Question 3
**Q:** Do you think you might be able to do better?

**Candidate:** Could I do better... No, because I don’t get any... Ok at first my intuition tells me that no, because I don’t have any intuition—because I don’t get any information when I discard a card, so the—

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** Yes, it's possible to do better. The goal is to maximize the chance of drawing a card of the same color as the first card drawn. By discarding a card of the opposite color, you increase the proportion of cards of the desired color remaining in the deck.

**Key Concepts:** probability, conditional probability, maximizing probability

---

### Question 4
**Q:** No, I’m talking about rather than discarding the second card, can you do better than that if you pick the card instead?

**Candidate:** If I pick the—at what turn, first turn or second turn?

**Evaluation:** Partially

**Model Answer:** The question is asking if picking the second card is a better strategy than discarding it. If the goal is to maximize the value of the cards held, then picking the second card is generally better, as it gives you a chance to improve your hand.

**Key Concepts:** Decision making, Maximizing value, Game strategy

---

### Question 5
**Q:** Second turn. First card is a 30. You told me that already the immediate expected value of picking a card is 23.3 versus 25 of discarding right?

**Candidate:** Uh yes. Ok, maybe, maybe I can do better if I try to get to the 40 and then discard the rest. So let’s say I do a strategy where I turn face up until I found 40 and then discard the rest. So in one third of chances, I will—in the end I will have 40 plus 50—90 dollars. In one third chance I will have 15 plus 40—55 plus 25, that should be 80. And in one third chance I will... I will get 70. So yeah, actually yeah, this is better. This strategy is better. So expected value is 80 with this strategy.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "No",
    "model_answer": "The candidate's calculation of the expected value is incorrect. The strategy of turning cards until a 40 is reached and then discarding the rest 

---

### Question 6
**Q:** Yep, correct. So total including the 30 would be 110. Versus if you just discard the last three cards and actually you would only have 105. So this is better indeed.

**Candidate:** Yes.

**Evaluation:** Yes

**Model Answer:** Yes, the candidate's answer is correct. The calculation confirms that including the 30 cards results in a total of 110, which is indeed better than discarding the last three cards and having only 105.

**Key Concepts:** basic arithmetic, comparison of quantities

---

## GAME THEORY

### Question 1
**Q:** So, yes, so very quickly what’s a lower bound—like what’s a very easy lower bound for the value of the game?

**Candidate:** Lower bound for the value of game is definitely… Hmm, that should be... 100?

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** A very easy lower bound for the value of a game is the minimum payoff any player can guarantee themselves, regardless of the opponent's strategy. For example, if a player can always ensure they receive at least 100, then 100 is a lower bound.

**Key Concepts:** lower bound, game theory, guaranteed payoff, minimax theorem

---

### Question 2
**Q:** So intuitively, why is the game worth more than 100?

**Candidate:** Because of the cards worth 30 and 40 points. So—and because of them, they are larger than discarding—than the move of discarding—and 10 and 20 we can, let's say, replace them with a discard and get more value out of them. So that’s kind of intuition.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "Partially",
    "model_answer": "The game is worth more than 100 because holding high-value cards (30 and 40 points) allows players to potentially score more points than t

---

### Question 3
**Q:** What do you think the expected value of the game is if you pull 40 first?

**Candidate:** It should be a little bit larger, maybe about 112.5. Maybe something around that.

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** The expected value of the game is 100. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of winning (0.5) by the prize amount (200). The number of pulls does not affect the expected value of a single pull.

**Key Concepts:** Expected Value, Probability, Independent Events

---

## MARKET MAKING

### Question 1
**Q:** So what's your market?

**Candidate:** 108.5 and 109.5.

**Evaluation:** No

**Model Answer:** The question asks about the market, which typically refers to the target customer segment or industry. The answer provided, '108.5 and 109.5,' appears to be numerical data, possibly related to price points or a specific metric, but it doesn't describe the market itself.

**Key Concepts:** market definition, target audience, industry analysis

---

### Question 2
**Q:** So can you make me a market on the number of iPhones sold in America in 2024, in millions? And can you make it five million wide?

**Candidate:** Five million wide? Ok, so let’s say America has about… 300... Around 300 million people. So, and most of them has—have an iPhone. Let’s say around… 60… 50? 50? Around 50 million. So 47.5, 52.5. Let's do that.

**Evaluation:** Unknown

**Model Answer:** ```json
{
    "is_correct": "No",
    "model_answer": "Estimating iPhone sales in the US for 2024 requires understanding market penetration, upgrade cycles, and new product launches. A reasonable esti

---

## CAREER_PATH

### Question 1
**Q:** Did you ever consider to be a trader instead of researcher?

**Candidate:** Uh yeah, so actually I did a trading internship when I was in university at another trading firm. But for me, the thing that pulled me away was, as a trader you are a little bit more into making kind of on-the-fly decisions and less about longer-term work. And one thing that from my background was appealing is just being able to work on more longer-term projects and thinking a little bit more deeply about problems. But that being said, I think at Da Vinci more than other trading firms, it's a little bit less clear the distinction between a quant researcher and a trader, and it's a quant trader. Because essentially there's no clear distinction in work. So I would bet even now I spend a lot of my time trading because I think it gives me better ideas and I can understand the market a bit better, and then traders also spend time doing research projects. So it’s not something I would worry too much about the distinction of, at least at Da Vinci. That's more or less why I chose.
