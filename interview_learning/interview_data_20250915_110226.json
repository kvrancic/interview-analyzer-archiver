    "answer": "Five million wide? Ok, so let\u2019s say America has about\u2026 300... Around 300 million people. So, and most of them has\u2014have an iPhone. Let\u2019s say around\u2026 60\u2026 50? 50? Around 50 million. So 47.5, 52.5. Let's do that.",

    "question": "Uh yeah, so actually I did a trading internship when I was in university at another trading firm. But for me, the thing that pulled me away was, as a trader you are a little bit more into making kind of on-the-fly decisions and less about longer-term work. And one thing that from my background was appealing is just being able to work on more longer-term projects and thinking a little bit more deeply about problems. But that being said, I think at Da Vinci more than other trading firms, it's a little bit less clear the distinction between a quant researcher and a trader, and it's a quant trader. Because essentially there's no clear distinction in work. So I would bet even now I spend a lot of my time trading because I think it gives me better ideas and I can understand the market a bit better, and then traders also spend time doing research projects. So it\u2019s not something I would worry too much about the distinction of, at least at Da Vinci. That's more or less why I chose.",
